# Sentiment-Analysis
Sentiment analysis of microblog data 

### Objective
The sentiment of tweets is an important task that helps to determine the usersâ€™ perceptions of organizations, events or products. This assignment aims to develop a classifier to classify input stream of tweets into multiple sentiment classes (the simplest being just the positive, negative and neutral classes). One important resource in sentiment analysis is the dictionary of sentiment vocabulary, or sentiment lexicon, which may vary according to time (new sentiment terms may emerge) and classes or aspects (same term may have different sentiments with respect to different classes or aspects). Additionally, there are other data sources that will help enhance the project such as various social factors etc.

2. Run 'Step2_sentiment_analyzer_late_fusion.py' which performs the following:
- load preprocessed data
- perform handling of cases as per VADER
- perform valance scoring as per VADER
- include social features as enhancer
- outputs optimal precision, recall and f1 score of the default model, best model
